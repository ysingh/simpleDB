SimpleDB - a simple dictionary based database in Python
=======================================================

Creating the database
---------------------
SimpleDB reads a file containing data. The data in the file consists of documents, one per line.
Each document is a number of key: value pairs. It is assumed that all values are integers.
The DB reads such a file and stores each document as a python dictionary.
The database is stored as a list of such dictionaries in binary form.

Querying the database
---------------------
SimpleDB consists of a  simple query engine. The query engine can read queries from the command line or text files.
 A parser first parses the queries. Then a validator performs simple and superficial validation
 ensuring the query is of the form db.final.<<operationName>>(args) where operationName is one of
 find, count, min or cartprod. The validator does not check the argument lists because different
 operations take in different kinds of arguments. The parser reads the query and detects which
 operation is being requested. It calls the correct method for the operation being requested,
 extracts the argument list and sends it to this method. Each method is responsible for parsing
 it's own argument list. Finally the methods, one for each operation, find(args), a_min(args),
 a_count(args), cartprod(args) perform the operations against the database file.
